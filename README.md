A Sequential model to convert  celsius to fahrenheit
There are many types of neural network architectures. However, no matter what architecture you choose, the math it contains (what calculations are being performed, and in what order) is not modified during training. Instead, it is the internal variables (“weights” and “biases”) which are updated during training.

For example, in the Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion problem, the model starts by multiplying the input by some number (the weight) and adding another number (the bias). Training the model involves finding the right values for these variables, not changing from multiplication and addition to some other operation.
